==========================================================
Thank you for your interest in using the Open Arc Routing Library
(OARLib).  There are two ways to use the library:

- The first is to simply use the included solvers to solve an 
instance of a Chinese Postman or Rural Postman problem.  To do this
just run the following command in the terminal:

java -Djava.library.path=<PATH_TO_SHARED_LIBRARIES> -jar 
<PATH_TO_ArcRoutingLibrary.jar> <SOLVER_OPTION> <PATH_TO_
INSTANCE>

The PATH_TO_SHARED_LIBRARIES is whichever folder BlossomV.dll and
MSArbor.dll (or libBlossomV.jnilib and libMSArbor.jnilib for MAC
or libBlossomV.so and libMSArvor.so for Linux).  These are open
source implementations of common graph algorithms.  If the
included files don't work for you, and you see an 
UnsatisfiedLinkError, then please read the HOW_TO_INSTALL.txt for
how to compile your own shared library files.

The PATH_TO_ArcRoutingLibrary.jar should be self-explanatory.  If
you have already changed to that directory in the terminal, then
this is just ArcRoutingLibrary.jar .

The SOLVER_OPTION is a numeric code that tells the library which
solver you are attempting to invoke.

1 - is the exact Directed Chinese Postman solver
2 - is the exact Undirected Chinese Postman solver
3 - is Frederickson's Mixed Chinese Postman heuristic
4 - is Yaoyuenyong's Mixed Chinese Postman heuristic
5 - is Win's Windy Chinese Postman heuristic
6 - is Christofides's Directed Rural Postman heuristic
7 - is Benavent's Windy Rural Postman heuristic

The PATH_TO_INSTANCE is the location of the file containing the
problem instance.  See testOARLib.txt, testOARLib2.txt,
testOARLib3.txt, and testOARLib4.txt for examples of formatting
instances.  If you wish to create your own instances, we recommend
using this format.  For testing purposes, the instances included in the test_instances folder are also acceptable formats.

For example:

java -Djava.library.path=/home/046 -jar ArcRoutingLibrary.jar 3 test_instances/MCPP_Instances_Corberan/MA0532

-The second way to use the library is by importing the .jar file
into your own java project, and using the documentation (currently 
a work in progress) provided to leverage the graph architecture.  
To do this, just include  ArcRoutingLibrary.jar as a library using 
your IDE of choice.
