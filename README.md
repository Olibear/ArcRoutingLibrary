ArcRoutingLibrary
=================

This project is still in development, and in an unstable state currently.

Developed as part of my time as a graduate student at the University of Maryland's Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computation program, this library is intended to be a collection of problem abstractions and solver implementations for some common arc-routing problems.  

In addition to some common utilities and presentational tools that should prove useful to operations researchers, the following problems are currently in development: Chinese Postman Problem (Directed, Undirected, Mixed, Windy), Rural Postman Problem (Directed).

Tutorials to follow completion.
