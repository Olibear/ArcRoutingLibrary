==========================================================
Thank you for your interest in using the Open Arc Routing Library
(OARLib).  The library makes use of a couple other open source codes
that are written in C/C++.  In order to interface with these, we use
the Java Native Interface (JNI).  This requires the use of shared 
library files, (.dll for Windows, .jnilib for MAC, and .so for Linux).
We have compiled these for what we anticipate to be the most common
user configurations.  However, we understand that some users may
be using architectures that we did not anticipate.  If so, please 
follow the instructions to compile your own shared library files:

BLOSSOM V:

-Download the Blossom V code at: http://pub.ist.ac.at/~vnk/software.html
-Copy the files oarlib_graph_util_BlossomV.cpp, and
oarlib_graph_util_BlossomV.h into the folder
-Run the command: g++ -shared -fPIC -I/opt/jdk1.8.0_25/include -I/opt/jdk1.8.0_25/include/linux oarlib_graph_util_BlossomV.cpp PMinterface.cpp PMmain.cpp misc.cpp PMduals.cpp PMexpand.cpp PMinit.cpp PMrepair.cpp PMshrink.cpp MinCost/MinCost.cpp -o libBlossomV.<EXTENSION>

where the first two file paths should be where your jdk is located
and EXTENSION is:

.dll - Windows
.jnilib - MAC
.so - Linux

-Download the MSArbor code at: http://www.di.unipi.it/optimize/Software/MSA.html
-Copy the files oarlib_graph_util_MSArbor.cpp, and
oarlib_graph_util_MSArbor.h into the folder
-Run the command: g++ -shared -I/opt/jdk1.8.0_25/include -I/opt/jdk1.8.0_25/include/linux oarlib_graph_util_MSArbor.cpp MSArbor.C -o libMSArbor.so

where the first two file paths should be where your jdk is located
and EXTENSION is:

.dll - Windows
.jnilib - MAC
.so - Linux

With your shared library files, move them into the running directory,
or provide the -D<PATH_TO_SHARED_LIBRARIES> flag when running your code.

If this is done incorrectly, you will most likely see an 
UnsatisfiedLinkError when you attempt to run a solver that tries to
use either a Min-Cost Matching or Minimum Spanning Arborescence
procedure.
